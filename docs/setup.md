# Tsukinome — setup guide

This walks you from nothing to a running Tsukinome that turns issues into PRs on a repo.
You install it **once** as a GitHub App; target repos need **no config files**.

## 1. Prerequisites

- Node.js ≥ 20
- A Postgres database with the **pgvector** extension available (Neon works; locally,
  `pgvector/pgvector:pg16` is the easiest). Tsukinome runs `CREATE EXTENSION vector` in a
  migration, so the extension must be installable.
- An **Anthropic API key** (model calls). With the bring-your-own-key setup page enabled
  (Phase 12), each installation supplies **its own** key and the operator key is optional — see
  "Bring-your-own-key" below.
- A **32-byte master encryption key** (`MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY`) for encrypting stored keys at rest —
  generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`.
- An **E2B API key** (ephemeral sandbox that clones the repo and runs its tests).
- (Optional, for the code index) Python 3 with the CocoIndex sidecar deps installed in a venv —
  see "Code index" below. The core pipeline runs without it; it powers richer plan-time retrieval.

## 2. Create the GitHub App

GitHub → **Settings → Developer settings → GitHub Apps → New GitHub App**.

- **Webhook URL:** `https://<your-host>/api/github/webhooks`
- **Webhook secret:** generate one; you'll set it as `WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
- **Repository permissions:**
  - **Contents:** Read & write (commit the branch + artifacts)
  - **Issues:** Read & write (acknowledge, ask clarifications, post the cost summary)
  - **Pull requests:** Read & write (open the PR, reply to review comments)
  - **Metadata:** Read-only (default)
- **Subscribe to events:**
  - **Issues** (`issues.opened`)
  - **Issue comment** (`issue_comment.created` — clarification + plan-gate replies)
  - **Pull request review** (`pull_request_review.submitted` — `changes_requested`)
  - **Pull request review comment** (`pull_request_review_comment.created` — inline fixes)
  - **Installation** (`installation.deleted` — purge the installation's stored key on uninstall)
- **Bring-your-own-key setup page (optional but recommended — Phase 12b):**
  - **Setup URL:** `https://<your-host>/setup` and tick **Redirect on update** so a fresh install
    lands there with its `installation_id`.
  - **Callback URL:** `https://<your-host>/setup/callback` (the OAuth return).
  - Generate a **client secret** under the App's OAuth section. The **Client ID** + secret become
    `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` / `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`; the public origin becomes `SETUP_BASE_URL`.
  - This lets an installation manager paste **their own** Anthropic key, verified via GitHub OAuth.
    Leave these unset to run without the page (see "Bring-your-own-key" below).

After creating it:

1. Note the **App ID**.
2. Generate a **private key** (`.pem`); its contents become `PRIVATE_KEY`.
3. **Install the App** on the account/repos you want Tsukinome to work on.

> The runtime mints a per-run, single-repo, `contents: read` token for cloning — separate
> from the App's write credentials, and redacted from logs. See `docs/security.md`.

## 3. Configure the environment

Set these (e.g. in your host's secret manager, or a local `.env`):

| Variable | Required | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `APP_ID` | yes | — | From the App settings page. |
| `PRIVATE_KEY` | yes | — | The full `.pem` contents (newlines preserved). |
| `WEBHOOK_SECRET` | yes | — | Must match the App's webhook secret. |
| `MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | yes | — | Base64, decodes to **32 bytes** (`openssl rand -base64 32`). Encrypts per-installation keys at rest (AES-256-GCM). |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | fallback only | — | Operator/platform key. **Optional** under BYO; required only when `ALLOW_PLATFORM_KEY_FALLBACK=true`. |
| `ALLOW_PLATFORM_KEY_FALLBACK` | no | `false` | When `true`, installations with no key on file use the operator `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (self-host / dogfooding). Off → missing keys are refused, never billed to the operator. |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` | setup page | — | GitHub App OAuth client id (enables the setup page). |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` | setup page | — | GitHub App OAuth client secret. |
| `SETUP_BASE_URL` | setup page | — | Public origin (no trailing slash), e.g. `https://tsk.example.com`. Used for OAuth redirects + setup links. |
| `E2B_API_KEY` | yes | — | Sandbox for clone + test runs. |
| `E2B_TEMPLATE` | recommended | base image | Custom sandbox template pinned to Node ≥ 22 (see below). Without it, E2B's base image ships Node < 20.12 and `npm test` fails at import for modern-Node repos. |
| `DATABASE_URL` | yes | — | Postgres connection string (pgvector-capable). |
| `COCOINDEX_PYTHON` | optional | `python3` | Path to the venv interpreter that has the code-index sidecar deps (see below). Unset → bare `python3`; if that lacks the deps, plan-time code retrieval degrades gracefully. |
| `RUN_BUDGET_USD` | no | `1.00` | Per-run model-spend ceiling. |
| `PORT` | no | `3000` | Webhook HTTP port. |

> This environment's permission settings block editing `.env*` from the agent, so there is no
> `.env.example` in the repo — use the table above as the source of truth.

### Bring-your-own-key (per-installation Anthropic key)

As of Phase 12, model spend is billed to **each installation's own Anthropic key**, resolved
per run and encrypted at rest (E2B and the database stay operator-owned). There are two ways to
supply keys:

- **Setup page (recommended).** Set `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`, `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `SETUP_BASE_URL`,
  and configure the App's Setup + Callback URLs (above). After installing, the manager is sent to
  `/setup`, signs in with GitHub (which proves they manage the installation), pastes their Anthropic
  key — validated live before storing — and can re-visit any time to rotate it. Uninstalling purges
  the key automatically. If a run starts before a key is set, Tsukinome refuses gracefully with a
  comment linking to the setup page (no tokens spent).
- **Operator fallback (self-host / dogfooding).** Leave the setup page unset, set
  `ALLOW_PLATFORM_KEY_FALLBACK=true`, and provide the operator `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. Every installation
  then uses that one key — the pre-Phase-12 behaviour. With the page unset and fallback off, `/setup`
  renders a "not configured" notice and runs without a key are refused.

### Sandbox Node version (build the E2B template)

The TDD loop runs the target repo's `npm test` inside an E2B microVM. E2B's **default base image
ships an old Node** (< 20.12), so a suite that imports anything needing modern Node fails at *import
time* — e.g. `node:util`'s `parseEnv` (Node ≥ 20.12) or `require()` of an ES module (Node ≥ 22.12) —
and the loop can never observe green regardless of the implementation. Fix it once by building a
template pinned to Node 22 (`e2b.Dockerfile` is in the repo root):

```bash
npm i -g @e2b/cli
e2b auth login
e2b template build --name tsukinome-node22 --dockerfile e2b.Dockerfile
```

Then set `E2B_TEMPLATE=tsukinome-node22` (or the printed template id). Leaving it unset falls back to
the base image and is only safe for target repos that run on old Node.

**Multi-language repos (Python).** As of Phase 13b, Tsukinome also accepts **Python** repos and runs
their suite with `pytest` (installing deps best-effort via `pip`). For a Python target the sandbox
image must carry a **Python 3 runtime + pip** as well as Node — so build the template from a base that
has both (extend `e2b.Dockerfile` to install Python, or point `E2B_TEMPLATE` at a multi-toolchain
image). One image carrying every supported toolchain is the intended setup; the per-language template
override (`Toolchain.sandboxTemplate`) is reserved for later if a single image gets unwieldy. Which
pack a run uses is chosen from the repo's GitHub language at intake and pinned on the run.

### Code index (optional CocoIndex sidecar)

The Architect can plan against real repo code when the CocoIndex sidecar is available. It runs
**host-side** (not in E2B): it tree-sitter-chunks the checkout, embeds each chunk with a local
model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, no API key, ~$0), and writes rows into `code_chunks`. Retrieval and
teardown are owned in TypeScript. This is **optional** — with it unavailable the pipeline still
runs and simply plans from the spec without repo retrieval.

Install the deps into a venv and point the app at that interpreter:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r sidecar/requirements.txt
```

Then set `COCOINDEX_PYTHON=/absolute/path/to/.venv/bin/python`. The sidecar needs `DATABASE_URL`
to reach the same pgvector Postgres (the app passes it through automatically). The first run
downloads the embedding model and installs torch, so it is slow; subsequent runs are fast.

> CocoIndex is pinned to the `1.0.x` API line (`sidecar/requirements.txt`); 1.0 was a full rewrite
> of the pre-1.0 flow API. To verify the sidecar end to end, run the gated integration test:
> `COCOINDEX_TEST=1 COCOINDEX_PYTHON=$PWD/.venv/bin/python NODE_OPTIONS='-r dotenv/config' npx vitest run test/index/cocoindex.integration.test.ts`.

## 4. Migrate and run

```bash
npm install
npm run migrate up        # creates tables + the pgvector extension
npm start                 # webhook server + worker in one process
```

Health check: `GET /health` returns `200`. Webhooks land on `/api/github/webhooks`.

For local development without a public URL, use a webhook proxy:

```bash
npm run dev:smee          # needs SMEE_URL set to your smee.io channel
npm run dev               # tsx watch, same single-process server+worker
```

## 5. Use it

1. On a repo where the App is installed, **open an issue** describing the change.
2. Tsukinome comments to acknowledge, then commits a draft spec on `tsukinome/issue-<n>`.
3. If anything's unclear it asks **one batched set of questions** — reply on the thread.
4. It commits a `plan.md` and waits. Reply **`/approve`** to implement, **`/abort`** to stop,
   or describe changes to revise the plan.
5. It implements test-first (one commit per task) and **opens a PR** with a self-review and a
   **cost summary**. Review and merge — or leave review comments for a bounded fix loop.

Long-parked runs are nudged after ~3 days and closed after ~7 if there's no response; nothing
is ever merged without your approval.

## 6. Operating notes

- **Budget:** a run that hits `RUN_BUDGET_USD` stops gracefully with a comment. Raise the knob
  for larger changes.
- **Cost metrics:** `npm run debug:cost-metrics` prints runs, total spend, and measured average
  cost/issue.
- **Reliability:** jobs retry with exponential backoff and are dead-lettered (with a failure
  comment) after the attempt cap; a crashed worker's in-flight job is reclaimed by its lease.
- **Supported repos:** TypeScript/JavaScript and **Python** (Phase 13b); other languages are refused
  gracefully with a comment. Support is a "language pack" per toolchain — see `src/toolchain/`.
